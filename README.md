# Hello SLIDER pupils!

we are trying to learn some css, by making a SLIDER!!!

## file 1 - play.html -> playing...
in this file we just show a basic example for replacing images

we use most simple `position:absolute` and `left:-100%`, with basic script to repeatedly give incrementing element the `show` class
