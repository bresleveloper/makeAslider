# Hello SLIDER pupils!

we are trying to learn some css, by making a SLIDER!!!

## file 1 - play.html -> playing...
in this file we just show a basic example for replacing images

we use most simple `position:absolute` and `left:-100%`, with basic script to repeatedly give incrementing element the `show` class

## how to get your images from git
* goto your images folder in git
* click an image
* click download button
* copy url

resulst should be like

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bresleveloper/makeAslider/master/img/1.png`

change `bresleveloper/makeAslider` to your username/reponame

and `img/1.png` to your folder/imagename
